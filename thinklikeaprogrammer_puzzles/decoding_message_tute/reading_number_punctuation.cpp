/* the numbers come in, and different numbers are seperated
by commmas and end of line.

As such a loop should check for either end of line haracer or a comma.
A larger loop will continue untill all numbers are read,
then the inner loop should only stop for a comma or EOL.

The outer loop stops for EOL when the whole line has finished. */
