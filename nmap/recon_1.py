#this is a major work in progress

#This code runs a normal TOP 1000 ports scan and writes it to a file. You can then start using this
# it will then run a full TCP scan and run extra NMAP scripts based on the ports found
# working on adding dirbuster, smb enumeration and others that are not nmap related


#to add multi process
